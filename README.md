# startingpoint.sh

## Description

The `startingpoint.sh` script automates key steps of a basic penetration test. It begins by identifying live hosts within a specified IP range using a ping scan. For each detected host, it performs a detailed scan using `nmap` to discover open ports, service versions, and operating systems. The script then automatically searches for potential exploits related to the discovered services and versions using `searchsploit`.

### Key Features
- **Ping Scan**: Identifies active hosts in the specified IP range.
- **Nmap Scan**: Scans the active hosts for open ports, service versions, and operating systems.
- **Exploit Search**: Searches for known vulnerabilities and exploits related to the discovered services and versions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- `nmap`
- `searchsploit` (part of the `exploitdb` package)

## How to Use

### 1. Make the Script Executable

Before running the script, make it executable by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
chmod +x startingpoint.sh
```

### 2. Execute the Script

Run the script by providing the target IP range or a specific IP address as an argument. For example, to scan the network range `192.168.1.0/24`, use:

```bash
./startingpoint.sh 192.168.1.0/24
```

### 3. Output

- The script will output the active hosts found, details from the `nmap` scan, and the results of the `searchsploit` search.
- Results are saved in separate text files for each IP, such as `nmap_scan_<IP>.txt` and `searchsploit_<IP>.txt`.

## Example

To perform a scan on the network `192.168.1.0/24`, you would run:

```bash
./startingpoint.sh 192.168.1.0/24
```

This will perform a ping scan on the specified IP range, identify live hosts, perform an `nmap` scan for open ports and service versions, and then search for related exploits using `searchsploit`.
